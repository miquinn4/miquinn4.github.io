            <h2>SNOOPY!!!</h2>
                <p>Although Snoopy can't actually talk readers can still read his thoughts. Because of the situations Snoopy finds himself in, there are dozens of strips where Snoopy makes and appearance doing something random and crazy, as well as whole strips dedicated to stories starring just Snoopy.</p>
                
                <p>Many of Snoopy's stories also feature his best friend and sidekick, Woodstock, a little yellow bird of which his species is unknown. Woodstock first appeared in 1966 but he wouldn't receive his name until 1969. He is named after the famed music festival of the same name that took place in Woodstock, New York 1969. In one of the first comic strips in which he appears, Woodstock explains to Snoopy who is pretending to be The Flying Ace at the time, that he struggles with flying and does not like flying south every winter. The Flying Ace comes to understand that Woodstock is his new personal mechanic for his plane, giving Woodstock his first supporting role as Snoopy's sidekick. He is also Snoopy's secretary when snoopy is pretending to be an author; and Woodstock is also Snoopy's caddy whenever Snoopy goes golfing. Woodstock can technically speak but to the reader his thought bubbles appear as "chicken scratch", Snoopy is the one to translate anything that Woodstock says in the stories.</p>

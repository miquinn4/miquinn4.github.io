        <h2>Red Bull gives you wings</h2>
            
        <p> The company Red Bull was launched in 1984 after the company's founder, Dietrich Mateschitz, was inspired by "functional drinks from East Asia" to make a new type of drink, an energy drink. He spent 3 years working on the formula for Red Bull as well as the marketing and everything else inolved with launching a product. He officially launched Red Bull in Austria on April 1, 1987 in Austria before expanding to other countries, eventually selling Red Bulls in the U.S. starting in 1996.</p>

            <h2>Origins</h2>
            
            <p> 
            Halloween gets its inspiration from an ancient Celtic called Samhain, a pagan religious celebration to welcome the end of summer harvest, at which people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. When Pope Gregory III declared November 1 All Saints Day some elements of the ancient Celtic festival were incorporated into it, with the day before All Saints Day coming to be known as All Hallows Eve (Halloween). The Celtics also believed that during the festival, spirits walked the Earth and in order to avoid catching the attention of one of the evil spirits walking the Earth the Celts wore scary costumes during the festival to confuse them into being left alone. Black Cats wouldn't come around until the middle ages, when they were considered to be a symbol of the Devil. Trick or Treating would also come around in the middle ages when children and poor adults would go door to door on All Saints Day collecting money and food in return for prayers for the dead.

            Thanksgiving, you either love it or hate it. A holiday dedicated to spending two days cooking food to eat with family around the dinner table or around the t.v. watching Thursday Night Football. Macy's even closes down 34th street in New York City to take 49 giant character balloons on a walk with a marching band to celebrate the occasion. Or if you don't feel like having the day off, you can participate in your local neighborhood Turkey Trot and run 5 to 10kms instead.

            <h2>Origins</h2>
            
            <p>
            Thanksgiving comemorates the celebratory feast between the Pilgrims and Wompanoag in November of 1621 after a mutual peace agreement had led to a successful harvest, ensuring the survival of both groups for the winter. The feast lasted three days, however it is unkown what the meal fully consisted of. The first official Thanksgiving holiday came in 1777 in commemeration of the American victory agaist the British in the Revolutionary War. George Washington called for this to be on the last Thursday in November.

            <h3>Is Autumn the best season?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Autumn features bright colors, cooler weather, while still being warm enough for it to rain rather than snow (depending on where you are). There are also a variety of different autumn related activites to pick from. There is a fair share of the more fun holidays. I can't really think of anything negative to say about autumn, and is easily the best season.</p>

            <h1> 
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>
            </h1>
            
            <h4>
            The New York Times is acceptable. The New York Times website opens to their logo and their navigation section as well as the immediate option to switch to one of a handful of other languages if needed; if you scroll down the page it begins to get a little chaotic and busy with all of the day's major headlines all in one small place competing for your attention. The white background doesn't really help in that regard; although it gives the website a more sleek look, it makes the photos stand out more and since they are all somewhat close to each other it can get a bit overwhelming. However this issue of overcrowding and looking busy would most likely be my one major complaint about the website.  
            </h4>
            
            <h4>
            The code, although elaborate, is very neat and organized. The navigation bar at the top of the page follows you, continuing to stay at the top of your screen even after you scroll further down the page; which is one of my favorite features since it adds a level convenience, allowing users to move around the website easily without having to scroll all the way to the top of the page to find the navigation bar. If you hover over each section in the navigation bar, another navigation appears with more specific options with sections within the different topics including the links to their corresponding podcasts which is another feature I find to be useful for users who may like to listen to their news rather than listen to it. 
            </h4>
            
            <h4>
            When you go into a specific category from the navigation bar, the page is a lot less crowded. There are, however, a lot more ads in these sections; although the ads seem to at least be on topic with the section you are in. There are also live stock readings in the top corner of the home page which I think is a nice touch. 
            </h4>
            
            <h1>
            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a>
            </h1>
            
            <h4>
            The BBC website has a well designed layout. When you first click on the site, you are met with their logo and navigation bar just like The New York Times. Their biggest headline is in the middle and hard to miss; it's surrounded by other big stories and must read headlines. The different sections and articles on the home page are clearly separated from one another with borders clearly marking the start and end of a category on the page. 
            </h4>
            
            <h4>
            The BBC utilizes a lot more large pictures, making it less chaotic since there are less photos. The smaller photos are also all roughly the same size unlike The New York Times that had various different sizes; the BBC has a very clean and uniform look to their webpage. There are black bars on the home page indicating a video or group of videos which I think does a nice job adding contrast to the page but also breaking up the white background without having to add an abundance of color. Because the BBC also has a T.V. channel, there is also the option to watch it live on the website which is a convenient feature. The only thing I would change is I would put in sub-categories like the New York Times had in their navigation bar. The BBC doesn't have anything like that at all so when you click on any of the links in the navigation bar it takes you straight to that section of the website, but there isn't really way to specifically narrow down what you are looking for; for example going into the business section and wanting to only read the latest finance or tech headlines rather than everything that is happening in business. There are some sub-categories but they are very specific to certain issues and don't appear to overall be very useful to the average daily reader. 
            </h4>
            
            <h4> 
            As far as the coding for the website goes, it is not as neat and organized as the coding for The New York Times. In the body they utilize both classes and IDs, however their class names are really long using both letters and numbers.
            </h4>
            
            <h1>
                <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">The Washington Post</a>
            </h1>
            
            <h4>
            The Washington Post website is horrible. When you open the website you see the organization's logo like the BBC and The New York Times. Instead of seeing the navigation bar immediately underneath, instead they have their trending headlines; the navigation bar is ackwardly in the top left corner of the home page, execpt it's too long for the corner so it extedns into the middle of the page and looks wonky. Their big headlines are written in big text so only one maybe two might fit on your screen at a time; which I know I said above The New York Times was over-crowding their website, The Washington Post is almost under-crowding theirs since you can't really see very many stories at once the way they have their website set up. Since the stories are spread out and they use a white colored background, parts of their website feel almost empty or at least like there is a lot more open space that could be filled. 
            </h4>
            
            <h4>
            The navigation bar isn't hard to navigate, but again there aren't any sub-sections you can pick from, you can only go to the general section. These pages look a little more full since the links to stories are smaller so more fit on the screen, but there are no sub headings on many of the stories, only the headlines which the lack of text doesn't help with the emptt feeling but also if you aren't completely sold on an article by the title, you don't have anything else to read to decide whether or not to click on the article. There are a lot of column articles; as someone who doesn't care for columns, I don't like how approximately 1/3 of the screen is consistantly being taken up by The Washington Post trying to push columns for me to read when I'm more interested in reading the latest business or news headline instead; and especially since everytime I change pages, the columns offered don't change; if I don't want to read it on one page I'm not going to want to read it on another. 
            </h4>
        
            <h4>
            Regarding their coding, I immediatly found their meta tag atthe top of the head, there seemed to actually be about almost a dozen of them. The page I was looking at had links to many different articles as well as links to half a dozen css sheets as well. They utalize classes IDs in their code. It was overall somewhat organized but did not seem as put together as The New York Times and BBC. Overall, my opinion on this website, allthough it was still relatively easy to navigate, the design and layout left me desapointed, it felt lacking and left me wanting more from the website. It did not feel like the website is living up to it's full potential.

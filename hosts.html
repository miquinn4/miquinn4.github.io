    <p>GoDaddy offers the best services, of the three companies listed above. It has the most options available with plenty of features at the most reasonable prices. GoDaddy also seems to be the most user friendly especially for the first time user, while bluehost and Host Gator seem to be more geared toward someone who is already more established and knows what they are doing rather that being beginner friendly. GoDaddy is easier to navigate and overall seems like a better program and company to work with.</p>

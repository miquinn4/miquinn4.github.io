        <h1 id=title> 5 State Website Review </h1>
     <p> The States are listed from best website to worst. Each website is evaluated on a list of criteria including:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Is the page easy to navigate to?</li>
              <li>Is the page over crowded or is there too much going on?</li>
              <li>How visually appealing is the page to look at?</li>
              <li> How easy or hard is it to find a specific page.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="maryland"> <a href= "https://www.maryland.gov"> The Best Website: Maryland </a> </h2>
        <p>The Maryland state website opens to a search bar in the center of the page and the enblem that is found on the state flag. The website's background plays a video showcasing some of Maryland's scenic views. The website's menu also appears on the the right side of the page. There is a sliding menu under the search bar with more quick links for users to access other pages from. Those quick links specifically go to the sites for the Governor's Office, Maryland's Covid-19 response, and a "onestop" for all liscences, forms, permits, and applications a person could need. Even though I find the state of Maryland's website to be the best of the 5, there are still some things I would change about the website.Even though the website is easy to use, there is a lot going on when you first open the page and it can be a little overwhelming.The menu on right side side of the screen, although serves its purpose also takes up too much space on a computer screen. The menu column made the rest of the hime page seem very squished on the left side of the page. The menu would make the over all home page look better if it were to be made into a drop down menu instead and can be accessed by a push of a button rather than take up so much space.  </p>
        
        <h3 id="kansas"><a href= "https://www.Kansas.gov">Second Place: Kansas</a></h3>
        <p>The Kansas state website is simple and easy to navigate. There is nothing that is up front and in your face. The colors are nuetral and calm. The menu bar is at the top of the page, with more quick links found throughout the rest. There is a search bar in the top right corner of the page that is is easy to see. The website is also relatively accessable in a mobile phone version, with mot much difference in overall user ease and experience. </p>
    
        <h4 id="arkansas"><a href= "https://www.Arkansas.gov">Third Place: Arkansas</a></h4>
        <p>The Arkansas state website opens to a search bar in roughly the center of the page. It as also immedietly also opens to quick links for things like child support, vehicle registrations, and hunting and fishing liscences. If you scroll down further there are quick links to other resources that a person could need. However I found that if you clicked on the links and the further you went into the website the more confused I got. There are a lot of links on every page and the more links you press on and the further you got into the system, the less aesthetically pleasing and user friendly the different pages became. </p>

        
        <h5 id="maine"><a href="https://www.Maine.gov">Fourth Place: Maine</a></h5>
        <p>The official Maine website is set up decently well. There is a search bar in the middle of the page. There are links to the Governor's page and other local gvernment agencies as well as a link to sign up for SMS text notifacations. The overall set up of the main homepage is great however after digging deeper into the website, after pressing on one or two links you get to pages that aren't so well cared for. The pages look like they're stereotypical government websites. They have small font and a lot of words all jumbled together. The pages appear outdated and are not vbisually appealing. The pages look as if they were created a decade or two ago. </p>
        
        
        <h6 id="alaska"><a href="https://www.Alaska.gov">The Worst Website: Alaska</a></h6>
        <p>The Alaska state website comes in last simply because it is the least developed of the 5 options. It still has the menus with quick links to different pages. The search bar is in the top right corner like some of the other website. The Alskan state website is very minimal. There doesn't seem to be as much work put into the creation of their website compared to the other 4 states. There are quick links to the Governor's page as well as his social medias, as well as a couple of other things, how ever there doesn't seem to be as much thought put into user experience like the other sites. </p>
